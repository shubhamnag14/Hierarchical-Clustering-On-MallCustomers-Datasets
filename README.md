# Hierarchical-Clustering-On-MallCustomers-Datasets
<h3>Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.
  
# Required data
Hierarchical clustering can be performed with either a distance matrix or raw data. When raw data is provided, the software will automatically compute a distance matrix in the background. The distance matrix below shows the distance between six objects.
